For the first stage of the project, we will first obtain LD scores with varying window sizes (1cm, 5cm, 10cm and 20cm) to find a sensible window size to apply when estimating hg2. 

We have written the script in the cov-ldsc/Scripts/LDwindow.sh. You can run the script in this folder and the results will be saved in the cov-ldsc/Scripts/Outputs folder. 

In order for the script to run successfully, the prerequisites are the following python packages: 
1. Python (3 > version >= 2.7)
2. argparse
3. bitarray
4. numpy
5. pandas
6. scipy

You can call the program by adding flags:
-h (help)
-b (bfile name)
-c (genome-wide covariance or PCs). The first two column of the PCs should be family ID and individual ID and the rest of the columns will be the PCs. Note: for now, the individual order in the PCs should be the same as the order in .fam file.  
-l (It is the directory of ldsc.py file. When you run the script in cov-LDSC/Scripts folder, it will be ../ldsc.py)
